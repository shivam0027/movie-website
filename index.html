  <h3><strong>Movies</strong></h3>
  <p>A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture,
    is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas,
    stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images.
    These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.
    The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry,
    and to the art form that is the result of it. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film>Source</a></p>

  <h3>Sitcoms</h3>
  <p>A sitcom, clipping for situational comedy, is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set
     of characters who mostly carry over from episode to episode. Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy,
      where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and
      stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio,
     but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms.
